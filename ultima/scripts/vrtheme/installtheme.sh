# NOTICE #1
# Yes, you're right, this was initially written to allow easy parallel jobs in background.
# By simply adding & to the end of our WORK command we would run all these commands in parallel
# which would drastically reduce time needed for doing all of these tasks
# HOWEVER, unfortunately, AROMA or CWM recovery doesn't allow background tasks
# and immediately crashes when the first one is launched
# Therefore, we can't use background task at least now, maybe in future...
