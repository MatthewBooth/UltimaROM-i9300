How-To
======

If you would like to try the Experimental version, which is the most up-to-date, clone the Experimental branch to your computer and use the build.bat file to create a zip, and flash. If you do this, bare in mind, it may not work, there may be problems. You can let me know about any issues you think I haven't noticed at XDA, or the website.
